# telegram-bot-api-spec

This repository provides scripts to scrape the [Telegram Bot API documentation](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) for methods, types, and docstrings.

The primary use case for this data is to generate automated libraries that closely follow the Bot API documentation. Assuming the documentation is accurate, autogenerated libraries offer several benefits:
- **Easy Updates**: Simply regenerate the code using the latest Markdown specification.
- **Typo-Free**: All methods and fields are guaranteed to be correct.
- **No Missing Fields**: If it's in the spec, it's in your code!

## Output of the Script

The output of this script is `api_docs.md`, which includes:

- **Methods Section**: Each method is documented with its name, a link to the documentation, descriptions, fields (including their types and whether they are required), and possible return types.

- **Types Section**: Each type includes its name, a link to the documentation, descriptions, and fields associated with that type.
